# Snort-Based-Intrusion-Detection-ft.-ML-Models
 Snort Based Intrusion Detection using ML Models
 - Implemented different ML classification algorithms for intrusion detection using SNORT.
 - Evaluated the live working of our modified NIDS by performing attacks from Kali Linux Machine to Ubuntu Machine.
 - Used Snort to capture packets, preprocessed to get connection information, applied ML models to detect the attack
